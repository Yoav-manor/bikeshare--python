# bikeshare_systems
Made use of Python to explore data from Motivate data set (a bike share system provider for many major cities in the united states).
The objective was to build an analysis tool for the company. 
By taking raw input from a user, an interactive interface computes descriptive statistics and present data about different time ,location, and user types depending on input.
During the project I used  NumPy, pandas Series, and control flow tools to define functions for analysis.
